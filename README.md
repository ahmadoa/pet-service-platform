## Introduction

PawPal is a one-stop platform for pet owners to find, book, and manage a variety of essential pet care services such as grooming, training, etc... It connects pet owners with qualified professionals at a pet care center, providing a seamless and stress-free experience for both parties.

You can checkout the deployed project [here](https://pet-service-platform.vercel.app/), read more about the project in my medium article [Pawpal](https://medium.com/@ouladaouida/unveiling-the-journey-building-pawpal-07a034cfa2e8).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
